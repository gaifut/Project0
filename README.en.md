# Project0 Description in English

The goal of this project was to put my newly acquired theoretical skills of using Python into practice and learn new things as well as expand my existing knowledge.
This was my pet-project designed by myself (a friend of mine who is proficient in tech and development helped me set up the goals).

Description of the project aims and details:
- Create an interface that allows to upload information from csv files.
CSV file uploaded has the info about different orders, namely, it has specifics about the client and the manufacturer.
CSV file has some mistakes or inaccuracies in the address information of the customers
- The program should use API to check mistakes in address info and format it in a unified manner.
- The information should then be displayed in the GUI. 
- The interface should have an option to add order infomration - product, and quantity to each order.
- The system should then calculate the total price based on the item price and quantity.
- Item information is stored in a separate DB and can be added/removed from it.
- The modified file (with order info added) is uploaded to the SQL database.

This project allowed me to:
- Learn about and start using Tkinter, namely create GUIs and all the elements - buttons, frames, labels etc
- Practice writing code for reading files
- Learn working with external APIs
- Learn working with databases
- Learn using Pandas to work with databases
- Learn using Jira as a project management tool
- Develop general coding skills for specific project tasks, like programming a button to open a file and then referencing that opened file in the code
- Learn how to add complexity to the code, making all parts work together (also proper use of indentation)

Overall, it took me about 180 working hours to finish it. I coded, watched youtube videos to learn, read information in the manuals and different websites.
